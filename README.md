# InstaChain 📸  
A Decentralised Instagram Clone on the Blockchain

InstaChain is a decentralized Instagram-style photo-sharing application built with **Solidity**, **Hardhat**, **React**, and **TypeScript**. Users can connect their MetaMask wallet, create image posts with captions, and view a personalised feed made up of their own posts and those of their on-chain friends.

> 💡 This project was created as part of a learning journey into full-stack Web3 development. It leverages smart contracts for on-chain data handling and uses a modern frontend built with React and TypeScript.
